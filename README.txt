1. Zadatak - I have cloned the given repository into my local folder.


2. Zadatak - Seperated index.html file into pieces of needed files of PHP. 
	     Specifically created new folder for partial elements header, footer, sidebar.
	     Created index.php file as a main file to work with posts.

     // FIXED deleted index.php for now, and made posts.php main file to view through,
3. Zadatak - Made style changes to all h elements, also changed color of navbar and links,
	     turned headings into links as well.

     // FIXED Navbar elements color had to be changed to grey, because they werent visible,
	     because they are links and had the same color as navbar(except active links)

4. Zadatak  - Created new database and coded 3 posts. Then I've changed hardcoded posts in posts.php
	      Used foreach loop to list all posts fetched from database and fit them into the HTML div.
	      Created database.php to store all the necessary data for MySQL connection.
